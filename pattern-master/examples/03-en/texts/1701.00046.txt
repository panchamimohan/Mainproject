We study the flow equation of the O(N ) 4 model in d dimensions at the next-to-leading order (NLO) in the 1/N expansion. Using the Schwinger-Dyson equation, we derive 2-pt and 4-pt functions of flowed fields. As the first application of the NLO calculations, we study the running coupling defined from the connected 4-pt function of flowed fields in the d + 1 dimensional theory. We show in particular that this running coupling has not only the UV fixed point but also an IR fixed point (Wilson-Fisher fixed point) in the 3 dimensional massless scalar theory. As the second application, we calculate the NLO correction to the induced metric in d + 1 dimensions with d = 3 in the massless limit. While the induced metric describes a 4dimensional Euclidean Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space at the leading order as shown in the previous paper, the NLO corrections make the space asymptotically AdS only in UV and IR limits. Remarkably, while the AdS radius does not receive a NLO correction in the UV limit, the AdS radius decreases at the NLO in the IR limit, which corresponds to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in the original scalar model in 3 dimensions. .....................................................................................................

1 Introduction
In the previous paper[1], the present authors studied the proposal[2] that a d + 1 dimensional induced metric can be constructed from a d dimensional field theory using gradient flow[3Г6], applying the method to the O(N) 4 model. We have shown that in the large N limit the induced metric becomes classical and describes Euclidean Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space in both ultra-violet (UV) and infra-red (IR) limits of the flow direction. The method proposed in Ref. [2] may provide an alternative way to understand the AdS/CFT (or more generally Gravity/Gauge theory) correspondence[7], and the result in Ref. [1] might be related to the correspondence between O(N) vector models in d-dimensions and (generalized) gravity theories in d + 1 dimensions[8].
To further investigate a possible connection between Ref. [1] and Ref. [8] at the quantum level, one must calculate, for example, the anomalous dimension of the O(N) invariant operator 2(x), which requires the next-to-leading order (NLO) of the 1/N expansion for the flow equation to evaluate necessary quantum corrections. Since the method employed in Refs. [1, 2] is a specific one adopted for the large N limit, some systematic way to solve the flow equation in the 1/N expansion is needed.
In this paper, we employ the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) to solve the flow equation in the 1/N expansion for the O(N) invariant 4 model in d dimensions. Using this method we explicitly calculate the 2-pt and 4-pt functions at the NLO.
As the first application of the NLO calculations, we define a running coupling from the connected 4-pt function of flowed fields, which runs with the flow time t such that t = 0 corresponds to the UV limit while t =  is the IR limit. This property establishes that the flow equation can be interpreted as a renormalization group transformation. In particular at d = 3, we show that the running coupling so defined has not only the asymptotic free UV fixed point but also a Wilson-Fisher IR fixed point for the massless case.
As the second application, we investigate the NLO correction to the induced metric in 3 + 1 dimensions from the massless scalar model in 3 dimensions. In the massless limit, the whole 4-dimensional space becomes AdS at the leading order, as shown in Ref. [1]. The NLO corrections give a small perturbation to the metric, which makes the space asymptotically AdS in UV (t = 0) and IR (t = ) limits only. A remarkable thing is that, while the NLO corrections do not change the AdS radius in the UV limit, the AdS radius is reduced by the NLO correction in the IR limit, which corresponds to the Wilson-Fisher IR fixed point of the original theory. In other words, a nontrivial fixed point in the field theory leads to a change of the AdS radius in the geometry at the NLO. The induced metric at NLO
2

describes a 4-dimensional space connecting one asymptotically AdS space at UV to an other asymptotically AdS space at IR, which have different radii.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we first introduce the O(N) invariant 4 model in d dimensions. We then formulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) for the flowed fields, and solve it to derive 2-pt and 4-pt functions of flowed fields at the NLO. In Sec. 3, we define a running coupling from the connected 4-pt function of flowed fields and investigate its behavior as a function of the flow time t. In Sec. 4, we study the induced metric from the 3 dimensional massless scalar model at the NLO. We finally give a summary of this paper in Sec. 5. We collect all technical details in appendices. In appendix A, using the SDE, we present results at the NLO in the 1/N expansion of the d dimensional theory necessary for the main text. We also perform the renormalization of the d dimensional theory at the NLO, and explicitly calculate renormalization constants for various d. In appendix B, we give detailed derivations of solutions to the SDE for the flow fields at the NLO. We explicitly evaluate 2-pt and 4-pt functions of the flowed field in appendix C while we derive the induced metric in appendix D, for the massless scalar theory in 3 dimensions.

2.1 Model in d dimensions

In this paper, we consider the N component scalar 4 model in d dimensions, defined by the action

nent vectors such that 2(x)  (x) и (x) =

N a=1

х2

the

parameter, and u is the coupling constant of the 4 interaction, whose canonical dimension

is 4 - d. While it is consistent to take u as N independent, as will be seen later, the mass

parameter х2 is expanded as

where х2i is cut-off dependent in order to make the physical mass finite order by order in the 1/N expansion.

This model describes the free massive scalar at u = 0, while it is equivalent to the nonlinear  model (NLSM) in the u   limit, whose action is obtained from eq. (1) as

(4)

Some regularization which preserves O(N) symmetry is assumed in this paper, so that we can always make formal manipulations without worrying about divergences.1 Calculations of 2-pt and 4-pt functions at the next-to-leading order (NLO) of the 1/N expansion in d dimensions will be given in appendix A.

2.2 Flow equation in the 1/N expansion

In this paper, we consider the flow equation, given by

a(t,

(5)



a(0, x) = a(x),

where х2f and uf can be different from х2 and u in the original d dimensional theory. As in the case of d dimensions, uf is kept fixed and N independent, whereas х2f is adjusted as

х2f

=

m2f

uf 6

Z(mf ),

Z(mf )

Dq



ddq (2)d

(6)

where mf is a renormalized mass. The flow with хf = х and uf = u is called gradient flow, as it is given by the gradient of the original action.
In the case of the free flow (uf = 0), the solution is easily given by

a(t, x) = et( -х2f )a(x).

(7)

We therefore consider the interacting flow (uf = 0) hereafter unless otherwise stated.

1 We will call the infinite cutoff (  ) limit the 'continuum limit'.
4

The above flow equation leads to the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE)[9] as

Dzf a(z)O

Dzf

where z = (t, x), O is an arbitrary operator and the expectation value O should be

calculated in d dimensions as

na1иииan(z1, и и и , zn) = N n-1 ai(zi)  n[12 и и и n],

(11)

i=1

which is analogous to the d dimensional counterpart in eq. (A3). We consider only the

symmetric phase in this paper, where 2n-1 = 0 for all positive integers n. We consider the next-to-leading order of the 1/N expansion, so that the following two

SDE's need to be considered.

where zb = z1, so that the sum over b runs over the O(N ) index only. The connected part of 4- and 6- pt functions are introduced as

4[1234] = K4[1234] + N {2[12]2[34] + 2[13]2[24] + 2[14]2[23]} , (14)

+ N 2 {2[12]2[34]2]56] + 14 perms.} .

(15)

Furthermore decompositions in O(N) indices are given by

2[12] = a1a2(z1, z2),

(16)

K4[1234] = a1a2a3a4K(z1, z2; z3, z4) + 2 perms.,

(17)

K6[123456] = a1a2a3a4a5a6H(z1, z2; z3, z4; z5, z6) + 14 perms.,

(18)

where (z1, z2), K(z1, z2; z3, z4) and H(z1, z2; z3, z4; z5, z6) are invariant under the exchange of arguments such that z2i-1  z2i or (z2i-1, z2i)  (z2j-1, z2j).

2.3 Solutions to the flowed SDE at NLO

The solutions to the SDE at NLO are summarized below. Details of calculations can be

found in appendix B.

At the NLO, the 2-pt function is given by

where (t) is defined in eq. (B7), and the NLO contribution G1(t1, t2|p) is given in appendix B.3.2. In the continuum limit, (t) approaches to 0(t) and is finite as long as t > 0, where

3 Running coupling from flowed fields

3.1 Definitions Using the connected 4-pt functions g  ^g^ for the flow fields given in eq. (25), we define
the t-dependent dimensionless coupling as

g(t) = -3g^(t, t; t, t|{p}sym)t2-d/2,

(37)

where {p}sym is given by p2i t = 3/4 (i = 1  4) and p212t = p234t =  (pij = pi + pj), which is the symmetric point for d > 2, and t2-d/2 is introduced to make the coupling dimension-
less. Here  is an arbitrary dimensionless constant but we can take  = 1 without loss of

7

generality by the rescaling t  t. Explicitly we have

g^(t, t; t, t|{p}sym) = 4X^ (t, t|{p}sym) + 4Y^ (t|{p}sym) + Z^(|{p}sym),

(38)

where we remove ^ by defining O = ^O^ for O = g, X, Y, Z, and

X^ (t1, t2|12; 34) = (p22 + m2)(p23 + m2)

3.2 Free flow
For simplicity, we first consider the free flow, where g^(t, t; t, t|{p}sym) = Z^(|{p}sym). Taking  = 1, the running coupling is given by

which correspond to the asymptotic free UV fixed point and the Wilson-Fisher IR fixed point, respectively.

3.2.3 d  4 Since B(Q2) diverges as d-4 (log  at d = 4) at d  4, the running coupling vanishes as
the cut-off is removed (  ). Thus the theory is trivial in the continuum limit at d  4.

3.3 Interacting flow in the massless limit at d = 3

3.3.1 Massless limit
We next consider the interacting flow case, where we need to evaluate X^ and Y^ , which are difficult to calculate in general. We therefore consider the massless limit.2 In this limit, the kernel function is reduced to

K(t, s|{p}sym.) = Dd/2-1k0(Dt, Ds),

(49)

where

k0(w, v)

ev-w w 1-d/2 2d-1(2)d/2

(50)

and we regard D  Q2 = /t as an independent variable. Here the z integral is convergent

for d > 2 while the bubble integral B(0|Q) is finite for d < 4. We thus concentrate on the

d = 3 case hereafter.

2 We will indicate the massless limit by a subscript 0.

-1.60557(1) and 0(1) = 16.6753(1).

3 It turns out that G2() has only one zero at  = 0.36228(1).

where the coupling approaches from below to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in the 3 dimensional scalar theory. Note that the derivative of the  function with respect to g0 at the fixed point becomes

(g0)



d(g0) dg0

=

-1, g0 = G1

,

1, g0 = G1 + G2

(64)

which should be compared with the same quantities calculated for the standard running coupling in the 3 dimensional massless theory in Ref. [10], where (0) = -1 (UV) and (48) = 1 (IR). The derivative of the  function at the fixed point gives the anomalous dimension of the operator conjugate to the coupling in the conformal theory at the fixed point, and thus is universal. Our flow coupling indeed satisfies this condition and the derivatives at the two fixed points agree with those for the conventional definition of the coupling. This establishes that our flow coupling gives a good definition of the running coupling of the theory. The scaling dimension  of the operator conjugate to the running coupling g0 is given by  = d + (g0), so that UV = 2 and IR = 4 in this model. Interestingly UV = 2 corresponds to the canonical dimension of the 4 operator in 3 dimensions, which is the interaction term in our theory.
By the redefinition of the coupling as g(х)  (g0(х) - G1)/G2, the corresponding  function is simplified as

4 NLO corrections to the induced metric

In Ref. [1], the induced metric has been calculated from the flowed scalar field in the

large N limit. It has been shown that the metric from the massive scalar field describes a

space which becomes the Euclidean AdS space asymptotically both in UV and IR limits,

where the radius RIR in the IR is larger than the radius RUV in UV as

while the metric describes the whole AdS space in the massless limit with the radius RUV. In this section, we consider the NLO correction to the induced metric in the 1/N expansion

as another application of the NLO calculation, in particular, in the massless case at d = 3,

in order to see whether the space remains AdS or not and how the radius changes at the

NLO.

4.1 Induced metric at NLO

The VEV of the induced metric is defined from the normalized flowed field as[1]

which shows that the NLO correction is less singular than the LO contribution. Therefore the space becomes asymptotically AdS in the UV limit at the NLO whose AdS radius is equal to that at the LO.
We cannot naively take the    limit in eqs. (75) and (76), on the other hand, due to the enhancement of the UV contribution of the Q integrals. Careful evaluations of these

It is clear that the NLO correction to the AdS radius in the IR limit is related to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in the original 3 dimensional scalar theory, since the eqs. (75) and (76) can be written as

5 Summary
In this paper, we studied the flow equation of the O(N) 4 model in d dimensions at the NLO in the 1/N expansion, employing the Schwinger-Dyson equation. We calculated the 2-pt and 4-pt functions at the NLO.
As an application of the NLO calculation, we investigated the running coupling defined from the connected 4-pt function of flowed fields. In particular at d = 3 in the massless limit, we showed that the running coupling has two fixed points, the asymptotic free one in the UV region and the Wilson-Fisher one in the IR region. We also derived the corresponding

5 It is interesting and also suggestive to see that the F-coefficient of the 3 dimensional O(N ) scalar model

is given by FIR = FUV - (3)/(82) + O(1/N ), where FUV = N FS with FS  0.0638 as an example of a

conjecture, the so-called "the F-theorem", which claims that the F-coefficient monotonically decreases along

a RG trajectory connecting two 3 dimensional CFTs. Furthermore, in the holographic dual picture, the

F-coefficient is proportional to the AdS radius squared. (See Ref. [11] and references therein.)

function. Our study suggests that the flow equation can be interpreted as a renormalization group transformation.
We also calculated the NLO correction to the d + 1 dimensional metric induced from the massless scalar field theory at d = 3. In the massless limit, the whole 4-dimensional space becomes AdS at the LO of the 1/N expansion[1]. We found that the NLO corrections give small perturbations to the metric, which make the space only asymptotically AdS in both UV (t = 0) and IR (t = ) limits. In addition, while the NLO corrections do not change the AdS radius at the LO in the UV limit, the AdS radius is reduced by the NLO correction in the IR limit, which corresponds to the Wilson-Fisher IR fixed point of the original theory. The nontrivial fixed point in the field theory appears as a change of the AdS radius at the NLO. The induced metric at NLO describes a 4-dimensional space which connects one asymptotically AdS space at UV to the other asymptotically AdS space at IR.
This paper contains two important messages. One is that the flow equation can provide an alternative method to define a renormalization group transformation. The other is that the massless scalar field in d dimensions plus the extra dimension from the RG scale not only generates a d + 1 dimensional AdS space at LO[1] but also gives a NLO correction, which makes the d + 1 dimensional space asymptotically AdS only in UV and IR limits at d = 3. In particular, the AdS radius in the IR limit, which corresponds to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, becomes smaller than that in the UV limit, which is equal to the radius at the LO. Although the relation found in this paper between the massless scalar field theory and the induced geometry is very suggestive, further studies will be needed to establish an alternative interpretation of AdS/CFT correspondences proposed in Ref. [2] in terms of field theories.

A The 1/N expansion in the d dimensional theory
In this appendix, we consider the 1/N expansion in the d dimensional theory.

A.1 Schwinger-Dyson equation(SDE)

In order to perform the 1/N expansion, we consider the SDE of this model, which can be written compactly as

xaX[] = X[]xaS(х2, u) ,

where xab(y) = ab(d)(x - y) with a small parameter , so that

xaS(х2, u)

=

N (-

+

х2)a(x)

+

u 3!

a(x)2(x)

.

Here the vacuum expectation value of an operator O is defined in eq. (9).

We define 2n-point functions 2n6 as

a1a2иииa2n(x1, x2, и и и , x2n) = N 2n-1

2n
ai (xi )
i=1

 2n[12 и и и (2n)]

which can be written in terms of their connected parts K2n as

(A1) (A2) (A3)

4[1234] = K4[1234] + N {2[12]2[34] + 2[13]2[24] + 2[14]2[23]} , (A4)

6[123456] = K6[123456] + N {2[12]K4[3456] + 14 perms. } + N 2 {2[12]2[34]2[56] + 14 perms. }

(A5)

6 Note that we use the same notation 2n for the 2n-point functions in both d and d + 1 dimensions, since no confusion may occur.

16

and so on. As mentioned in the main text, we assume we are working in a phase where O(N) symmetry is not broken. We therefore do not add the external source term h(x) to the action, so that the action has the symmetry under   -, which implies 2n-1 = 0 for all positive integers n.
In terms of these, the SDE for X() = a2(x2) becomes

where 12  a1a2(d)(x1 - x2) and xb = x1, so that b in the summation runs over the O(N ) indices only.
For X() = a2(x2)a3(x3)a4(x4), on the other hand, we have

(A8)

Using the O(N) symmetry and assuming translational invariance (e.g. infinite volume or periodic boundary condition), we can write

x12  x1 - x2

K4[1234]  a1a2a3a4K(x1, x2; x3, x4) + 2 perms.,

(A9) (A10) (A11)

where K(x1, x2; x3, x4) is invariant under 1  2 or 3  4 as well as (12)  (34), and similar invariances hold for H(x1, x2; x3, x4; x5, x6).

A.2 The leading order in the 1/N expansion

We introduce the 1/N expansion as

K(x1, x2; x3, x4) = N -iKi(x1, x2; x3, x4), (A14)

i=0

i=0


and so on, together with х2 = N -iх2i .
i=0
At the leading order (LO) of the 1/N expansion, the eq. (A12) in momentum space

becomes 1=

at the LO becomes

eip(x-y) p2 + m2

(A17)

Eq. (A13) at the LO leads to

G0(p1, p2, p3, p4)(2)d(p1 + p2 + p3 + p4), (A19)

A.4 Renormalization
Let us now consider the renormalization of the theory. Our renormalization condition for the renormalized 2-pt function R is given in momentum space as

-R1(p)  p2 + m2,

p2  0,

(A32)

where m is interpreted as the renormalized mass, which is independent of both N and the
cut-off. Relating the bare field to the renormalized field by the renormalization constant ZR as ZR1/2R = , we explicitly obtain

ZRR(p)

=

(p)

=

p2

+

m2

1 +

1 N

1(p2)

+

O

1 N2

,

(A33)

where

1(p2) = Z1p2 + C~ + g~(p2).

(A34)

At the LO of the 1/N expansion, the above condition implies

х20

=

m2

-

u 6

Z (m),

ZR = 1,

(A35)

where Z(m) is potentially divergent at d > 1. We therefore introduce the momentum cutoff  to regulate the integral, and х20 is tuned to cancel the effect of Z(m) including such divergences, in order to keep the renormalized mass m finite and constant. The lattice regu-
larization or dimensional regularization is more consistent than the momentum cut-off, but

20

calculations become much more complicated in the lattice regularization or power divergences are difficult to deal with in the dimensional regularization. Since the momentum cut-off is enough to see the leading divergences, we adopt it in this paper.
At the NLO, the renormalization condition implies

(A37)

The renormalization condition for the coupling, which first appears at the NLO of the 1/N expansion, is given by G0(Q2 = s) = -ur(s)/3, so that ur(s) is regarded as the renormalized coupling at the scale s. Eq. (A20) thus leads to

ur(s)

=

(A38)

where B(Q2) is divergent at d  4. Therefore the renormalized coupling goes to zero as

at d  4. This indicates the triviality of the 4 theory at d  4.

B Solving the SED for the flow equation
In this appendix we explicitly solve the SDE in d + 1 dimensions, in order to obtain the 2-pt and 4-pt functions for the flow fields at the NLO.

B.1 Solution for 0

We first solve the equation at the LO for 0. If we introduce one unknown function F (t, p) as

0(12) =

Dp

F

(t1, p)F (t2 p2 + m2

,

p)

e-(p2+х2f

)(t1+t2)

eip(x1-x2)

(B1)

with the initial condition F (0, p) = 1, we have

D1f 0(12) =

F

(t1, p)F (t2 p2 + m2

e-(p2

0(t1) = 0(11) =

Dp

F 2(t1, p) p2 + m2

e-2(p2+х2f

)t1

,

(B4)

where F means a t-derivative of F . Then, the SDE (20) becomes

F (t, p) F (t, p)

=

-

uf 6

0(t),

(B5)

which tells us that F (t, p) is independent of p, so we put F (t, p) = F (t). The above equation is thus reduced to

F (t)

=

-

uf 6

F

(t)e-2х2f

(B6)

where 0(t) is defined in eq. (24), whose solution is given by

Dp

p2 + m2f p2 + m2

e2tх2f p2

e-2tp2 х2f

.

(B8)

In the case of the interacting flow with uf > 0, х2f negatively diverges as Z(mf )  + in the continuum limit at d > 1 or as uf  + in the NLSM limit. In these limits, (t) vanishes as

lim

O

(B9)

for t > 0. In the case of free flow (uf = 0), we simply have F (t) = 1.

We then obtain  
0(12) =

B.2 Solution for K0

We consider K0, which appears at the NLO. The equation for K0 in eq. (22) is closed, once 0 is obtained. Using eq. (26), we have

g(11;

.

From eq. (B15), one can easily see t2t1g(12; 34|12; 34) = 0, which implies

(B15)

g(12; 34|12; 34) = X(23|12; 34) + X(13|21; 34) + X(24|12; 43) + X(14|21; 43)

+ Y (2|12; 34) + Y (1|21; 34) + Y (3|43; 12) + Y (4|34; 12)

+ Z(|12; 34),

(B16)

where we require that X and Y satisfy X(,  |12; 34) = X( ,  |43; 21), X(, 0|12; 34) = 0, Y ( |12; 34) = Y ( |12; 43), Y (0|12; 34) = 0.

(B17) (B18)

Since g(12; 34|12; 34) agrees with the amputated connected 4-pt function in the d dimensional theory at i = 0 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), we obtain

Z(|p1, p2, p3, p4)

=

-^6/u

+

2 B(0|p34)

,

(B19)

where B(t|Q) is defined in eq. (31). Then one can easily check that g satisfies the required symmetries

g(12; 34|12; 34) = g(21; 34|21; 34) = g(12; 43|12; 43) = g(34; 12|34; 12). (B20)

B.2.1 Solution for Y

Terms which depend only on t1 in eq. (B15) can be written as

where (t|34) is defined in eq. (35). To solve this equation, we set

Y (t|21; 34) = ^(p21 + m2) t ds es(p21-p22)(s|34),
0

(B21) (B22)

28

satisfying eq. (B18). Eq. (B21) is reduced to

which shows  does not depend on p1, p2, where K is defined in eq. (34). Since uf F 2(t)e-2tх2f = uf Z(mf )/(t) goes to infinity in the continuum limit at t > 0 and d > 1 or
in the NLSM limit uf  , eq. (32) must hold in either of the two limits.

B.2.2 Solution for X

We next consider the solution for X. Terms depending on both t1 and t3 in eq. (B15), and thereafter replacing t3 by t2 and interchanging p1  p2, gives

We define

where properties of X imply (t1, t2|12; 34) = (t2, t1|43; 21) and (t, 0|12; 34) = (0, t|12; 34) = 0. Then the above equation becomes

C Calculations in the massless limit at d = 3

It can be shown that the flow bubble integral can be represented as

t
B(t|{p}sym.) = -2 ds K(s, 0|{p}sym.) + B(0|{p}sym.),
0

B(0|{p}sym.)

=

1 , 8D

which can be rescaled as

B(t|{p}sym.)

=

Rescaling 
(t|{p}sym.) = R0(Dt, D), (t|{p}sym.) = D0(Dt, D),

(C1) (C2) (C3) (C4)

the integral equation for  in the massless limit is written as

w
R0(w, D) + dv k0(w, v)0(v, D) = 0,
0

where

R0(w, D)

=

8b0(w)

u»(D) + u»(D)

u»(D) = u . 48 D

Since the problem is linear, we can write

0(w, D)

=

(01)(w)

-

8(02)(w)

u»(D) + u»(D)

,

(C7)

where (0i), i = 1, 2 solve the momentum-independent equations (56) and (57). We thus finally obtain eq. (52).

As the source term can be rescaled as

the equation for  in the massless limit is written for (t, s|{p}sym.) = DW0(Dt, Ds, D) as

We then evaluate

H[1] = 0(t),

H[p2]

H[p2G1(t, t|p)] = H[(t, t|p)] + 0(t)tH(t) - t0(t)1 = 0(t)tH(t) - t0(t)1, (D3)

where in the last equation we use H[(t, t|p)] = 0. Altogether we obtain

Since

I(t, t) = H[G1(t, t|p)] = 0,

the first two terms vanish. Further,

(D12)

t1t2I(t1, t2) t1=t2=t = H (p2)2G1(t, t|p) - 2p2(t, t|p) + t2(t, t2|p) t2=t + tH(t)t0(t). (D13)
Using the identities

H[(t, t|p)] = 0; H[p2G1(t, t|p)] = 0(t) tH(t)

(D14)

and their derivatives this can be further simplified:

t1 t2I(t1, t2)

(D15)

Here the second term vanishes and we finally obtain

(D16)

D.2 Calculation of H(t) in the massless limit We recall the definition of H(t) as

(t, t|p) = k2(t, t|p) + 2k1(t|p).

Here k1 and k2 are given Hereafter we consider

in eqs. (B46), (B47) and (B48). the massless limit at d = 3, where

we

have

R(t) = Rb(t) + R(i)(t), Rb(t)  4ttHb(t), R(i)(t)  4ttH(i)(t).
