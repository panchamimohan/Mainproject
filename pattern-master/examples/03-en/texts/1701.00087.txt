Anomaly induced transport in non-anomalous currents 
Eugenio Megías1,2,a 1Max-Planck-Institut für Physik (Werner-Heisenberg-Institut), Föhringer Ring 6, D-80805, Munich, Germany 2Departamento de Física Teórica, Universidad del País Vasco UPV/EHU, Apartado 644, 48080 Bilbao, Spain
Abstract. Quantum anomalies are one of the subtlest properties of relativistic field theories. They give rise to non-dissipative transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic expansion. In particular a magnetic field can induce an anomalous current via the chiral magnetic effect. In this work we explore the possibility that anomalies can induce a chiral magnetic effect in non-anomalous currents as well. This effect is implemented through an explicit breaking of the symmetries.

1 Introduction

The basic ingredients in the hydrodynamic approach are the constitutive relations, which are expressions of the energy-momentum tensor T µ, and the charge currents Jµ, in terms of fluid quantities [1].
These relations are supplemented with the hydrodynamic equations, which correspond to the con-
servation laws of the currents. However, in presence of chiral anomalies the currents are no longer conserved, i.e. µT µ 0 and µJµ 0. This leads to very interesting non-dissipative phenomena that already appear at first order in the hydrodynamic expansion: the chiral magnetic effect, responsible
for the generation of an electric current parallel to a magnetic field [2], and the chiral vortical effect, in
which the current is induced by a vortex [3]. The constitutive relation for the charge currents then read

Jµ = nuµ + BBµ + Vµ + · · · ,

vorticity vector. The transport coefficients responsible for the chiral magnetic and vortical effects, B

and V, have been studied in a wide variety of methods: these include Kubo formulae [4­6], diagram-

matic methods [7], fluid/gravity correspondence [8­11], and the partition function formalism [12­15].

It is already clear from these studies that the axial anomaly [16] and the mixed gauge-gravitational

anomaly [17] are responsible for the previously mentioned non-dissipative effects.

In this work we are going to focus on the Kubo formalism. The most significant result of anomalies

is that they produce equilibrium currents, and the corresponding conductivities are defined via Kubo

formulae that involve retarded correlators at zero frequency. The Kubo formula for the chiral magnetic conductivity was derived in [16], and it reads

A similar formula involving the energy-momentum tensor was derived in [4] for the chiral vortical conductivity. In this work we use this formalism to study the chiral magnetic effect of anomalous conductivities. We will study the possibility that, under certain circumstances, this effect might be present in non-anomalous currents as well.

2 The chiral magnetic and separation effects

The chiral magnetic (CME) and chiral separation (CSE) effects are examples of anomalous transport.
In the context of heavy ion collisions, a very strong magnetic field produced during a non-central
collision induces a parity-odd charge separation which can be modelled by an axial chemical potential, and as a consequence an electric current parallel to the magnetic field is generated, leading to
the CME [2, 16, 18]. On the other hand, chirally restored quark matter might give rise to an axial
current parallel to a magnetic field, known as CSE [19]. These effects have been predicted as well in condensed matter systems, see e.g. [20, 21].
Let us consider a theory of N chiral fermions transforming under a global symmetry group G generated by matrices (TA) f g. The chemical potential for the fermion  f is given by µ f = A qAf µA, while the Cartan generator is HA = qAf  f g where qAf are the charges. The general form of the anomalous induced currents by a magnetic field is

Ja = (B)abBb ,

(3)

where Bb is the magnetic field corresponding to symmetry b. The 1-loop computation of the chiral magnetic conductivity by using the Kubo formula of Eq. (2) leads to [6, 16, 17]

(4)

where dabc is the group theoretic factor related to the axial anomaly, which typically appears in the

computation of the anomalous triangle diagram corresponding to three non-abelian gauge fields cou-

pled to a chiral fermion. The subscripts R, L stand for the contributions of right-handed and left-

handed fermions. Anomalies are responsible for a non-vanishing value of the divergence of the cur-

rent, that reads in this case [22]

(5)

Let us particularize Eq. (3) to the symmetry group UV (1) × UA(1). Then there are vector and axial

currents induced by the magnetic field of the vector fields, i.e.

JV

JA

(6)

which correspond to the CME and CSE respectively. The question then arises: is it possible to get a chiral magnetic effect for a non-anomalous sym-
metry w? This means to have an induced current in symmetry w, i.e.

Jw 0 with dwab = dawb = dabw = 0 a, b.

(7)

In the rest of the manuscript we will study the possibility that anomalies can induce transport also in non-anomalous currents.

3 Holographic model

The Kubo formula Eq. (2) has been computed in [23­25] at strong coupling within a Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dim. In order to account for the anomalous effects, the model is supplemented with ChernSimons (CS) terms. In this work we will restrict to a pure gauge CS term, which mimics the axial anomaly. The action reads

where S GH is the usual Gibbons-Hawking boundary term. VM and AM are vector and axial gauge

fields, respectively, and WM is an extra gauge field associated to the non-anomalous symmetry w. The

anomalous term mixes the VM and AM fields. 1 A computation of the currents with this model leads to

J~µ stands for the holographic consistent currents, which are not gauge covariant in general. The covariant version of the currents, denoted by Jµ, is the usual one appearing in the constitutive relations, and it corresponds to the covariant part, dropping the CS current Kµ. An analysis of the divergence of
the covariant currents leads to the "covariant" anomalies:

3.1 Holographic model with symmetry breaking

In the following we are going to study the possibility that the constitutive relation for JWµ receives anomalous contributions. Let us extend the model of Eq. (8) with the contribution (S tot = S + S )

1 S  = 16G

d5 x -g - |DM|2 - m22 ,

DM = [M - i(AM - WM)]  ,

(13)

where  is a scalar field with a tachyonic bulk mass m2 = ( - 4), and 0    4. S  produces an explicit breaking of A and W symmetries via the scalar field . From the AdS/CFT dictionary, the
model is the holographic dual of a Conformal Field Theory (CFT) with a deformation

L = LCFT +  O ,

(14)

where O is an operator dual of the scalar field with dim O = , and  is the source of the operator with dim  = 4 - . The near boundary expansion of  reads

(r) = 4-r-4 + r- + · · · ,

r  ,

1We use the notation for capital indices M  {r, t, x, y, z}, and Greek indices µ  {t, x, y, z}.

(15)

EPJ Web of Conferences

where 4- is interpreted as the source , and  as the condensate O . In the following we will choose  = 3, so that the bulk mass is m2 = -3. The explicit breaking of symmetries is realized
via the boundary term limr r · (r) = M, where we have identified the mass parameter M with the
source in Eq. (15). Our goal is to study the induced currents

JV = V (M)B , JA = A(M)B , JW = W (M)B ,

(16)

where one expects a dependence of the conductivities in M. A non zero value for W (M) would signal the existence of a non-anomalous current induced by anomalies.

3.2 Background equations of motion

We will work in the probe limit, so that the metric fluctuations are neglected. The equations of motion

of the background (gMN , V M, AM, W M, ) can be solved by considering the AdS Schwarzschild

solution

(17)

and the background gauge fields

V = Vt(r)dt , A = At(r)dt , W = Wt(r)dt .

(18)

The chemical potentials are computed as µY  Yt(r  ) - Yt(rh) with Y = V, A, W. Then, the fields have the following near boundary expansion

lim r · (r) = M ,

(20)

It is convenient to define in the following new fields A1 = A - W and A2 = A + W, so that the covariant derivative writes DM = [M - i(A1)M] . The boundary expansions of A1,2 write as in Eq. (20), with chemical potentials µ1,2  µA  µW . Then, the equations of motion of the background read

where cV and c2 are integration constants. The solutions of A1 and  can be obtained numerically by solving the coupled system of differential equations, Eqs. (22)-(23). From these equations one can easily see that regularity of the solution near the horizon demands (A1)t(rh) = 0.

4 Conductivities in presence of symmetry breaking

The Kubo formulae for the conductivities appearing in Eq. (16) are:

Y

i = lim
pz pz

with Y = V, A, W .

(25)

These involve retarded correlators which can be computed by using the AdS/CFT dictionary, see e.g. [5, 26­28]. We will explain in this section the computation in some details.

4.1 Fluctuations

Without loss of generality we consider perturbations of momentum p in the z-direction at zero fre-

quency. To study the effect of anomalies it is enough to consider the shear sector, i.e. transverse

momentum fluctuations,

Kµ = Kµ(r) + kµ(r)eipzz , µ = x, y ,

(26)

where Kµ(r) refers to the background solutions computed in Sec. 3.2 for any of the fields V, A1,2 (or V, A and W), and kµ(r) are the corresponding fluctuations v, a1,2 (or v, a and w).
In studying the fluctuations it is useful to organize the equations of motion according to their
helicity under the transverse SO(2) rotation, which is a left-over symmetry. The equations for the fluctuations of the gauge fields are then classified into helicity ±1, and at order O() they read 2

(29)

where the fields are defined as v± = vx±ivy and (a1,2)± = (a1,2)x±i(a1,2)y. In order to obtain the retarded correlation functions we should perform a low momentum expansion of the fluctuation solutions, i.e.

v± = v(±0) + pzv(±1) + · · · ,

(a1,2)± = (a1,2)(±0) + pz(a1,2)(±1) + · · · .

(30)

From Eqs. (27)-(29) one gets the corresponding equations at order O(p0z ) and O(pz), which can be solved by imposing the appropriate boundary conditions for the fluctuation fields. In general we should consider regularity of the fields up to the horizon, and the sourceless condition, which means
that the fluctuations cannot modify the background fields at the boundary. Then

kµ(rh) = finite , kµ(r  ) = 0 ,

(31)

for any of the fluctuation fields kµ = v± or (a1,2)±. The only fluctuation that can be computed analytically is (a2)±, and the solution at order O(pz) reads

The sourceless condition for the fluctuations imply C0,v = C0,a1 = C0,a2 = 0. The other coefficients C2, C2 can be obtained from a numerical solution of the equations of motion of the fluctuations.

4.2 Conductivities

The correlators of Eq. (25) are contained in the coefficients C2,v, C2,a1 and C2,a2 . In particular, we have the following contributions

where the sign ± corresponds to the case A and W respectively. We show in Fig. 1 the result for the chiral conductivities of Eq. (38) after solving numerically the equations of motion of the fluctuations. We find a non zero value for W (M) in presence of explicit symmetry breaking, i.e. M 0. In particular, we observe the following properties:

· W (0) = 0 .

W ()

.

The first property is just the expected behavior of the conductivity of the non-anomalous symmetry W

in absence of symmetry breaking. The second one can be understood intuitively in the following way: In the basis (A1, A2) the CS term in the action is

1 S CS = 16G

d5x -g

(A1

 FV

 FV

,

(39)

so that both symmetries A1 and A2 have a CS interaction. The scalar field however breaks only A1. At M = 0 there will be CSE for both A1 and A2, but for large M, A1 will be badly broken and the CSE in the J1 current goes to zero. 3 Since 1 vanishes at M  , we find from Eq. (37) the second property.
3See [29] for a similar effect.

5 Discussion and outlook
In this work we have studied the role played by the axial anomaly in the hydrodynamics of relativistic fluids in presence of external magnetic fields. The anomalous conductivities have been computed by using Kubo formulae. The most interesting result is the characterization of a novel phenomenon related to the possibility that, when symmetries are explicitly broken, anomalies can induce transport effects not only in anomalous currents, but also in non-anomalous ones, i.e. those with a vanishing divergence. We have studied this phenomenon at strong coupling in a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dim supplemented with a pure gauge Chern-Simons term. The symmetry breaking is introduced through a scalar field which is dual to an operator O with dim O = 3.
We plan to extend this study to other anomalous coefficients, like the chiral vortical conductivity. In addition, it would be interesting to check whether the mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly could induce any effect as well in non-anomalous currents. These and other issues will be addressed in detail in a forthcoming publication [30].
