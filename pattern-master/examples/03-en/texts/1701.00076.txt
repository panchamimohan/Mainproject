Abstract
The subject of fractional calculus has witnessed rapid development over past few decades. In particular the area of fractional differential equations has received considerable attention. Several theoretical results have been obtained and powerful numerical methods have been developed. In spite of the extensive numerical simulations that have been carried out in the area of fractional order dynamical systems, analytical results obtained are very few. In pursuance to this, present authors have extended local stable manifold theorem in case of fractional systems [1]. Cong et al. [2] have pointed out discrepancies in the asymptotic expansion of two-parameter Mittag-Leffler functions with matrix argument (cf. Lemma 4 part 2 of article [1]). In the present communication we give the corrected expansion of the same and prove the local stable manifold theorem by following the same approach given in [1].
1 Introduction
The area of fractional order dynamical systems (FODS) is being actively pursued in the last few years due to their applications in diverse fields including viscoelasticity [3], fractional order control systems [4], mechanics [5, 6], bioengineering [7], economics [8] and so on. The study of stability of FODS was initiated by Matignon in the year 1996 [9]. Further important development in this area was due to Grigorenko and Grigorenko [10] who studied fractional Lorenz system and proved that the order of the fractional derivatives act as a chaos controlling parameter. Since then a lot of simulation work has been carried out to explore various FODS [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In spite of extensive numerical work, analytical results obtained in this area are very few. Concept of flow is pivotal in the theory of dynamical systems. One of the major hurdle in the development of FODS is that their solutions do not satisfy semi-group property. As a consequence, concept of `flow' in fractional framework has not been satisfactorily formulated.
The local stable manifold theorem is one of the basic results in the realm of the dynamical systems. Present authors have generalized the local stable manifold for fractional systems. A proof of this theorem was presented in [1].

Cong et al. [2] have pointed out discrepancies in asymptotic expansion of two-parameter Mittag-Leffler function with matrix argument(Lemma 4, part 2) of the proof of local stable manifold theorem given by the present authors in [1]. In the present paper we provide correct formulation of the Lemma 4 part 2, and consequent changes in some expressions of Lemma 5, 6, 8 and the Step II of the proof of the main theorem given in [1]. Further we include the discussion about examples discussed both in [1] and [2]. Thus the proof of the local stable manifold theorem given by us in [1] continues to hold true in view of these corrections.

2 Corrections

The corrected version of Lemma 4 Part 2 of the ref. [1] is presented below. Note that the
Lemma 4 part 1 remains as it is. Lemma 4 part 2. For 0 < p < 1, j = 1, 2 и и и , l and q  N\{1}.

Let B(t) and C(t) denote the block diagonal matrices consisting of Bj(t) and Cj(t) on the diagonal respectively.
Then Ep,p(tpA) = t-pB(t) + C(t), where Jj and A are as defined in the paper [1].

Further it is noted that |C(t)| and |C(t)| have the same asymptotic behavior. Since

|C(t)|  K~1(q, r~)t-2p + K~2(q, r~)t-p-pq,

(9)

where K~1(q, r~) and K~2(q, r~) denote the arbitrary constants depending on q and r~. The revised version of [1, Lemma 6 (eqn. (35))] takes the following form:
Lemma 6. For any t,  > 0,

In view of the definitions of Bj and Bj it suffices to find the elements in the first row
of the matrix Bj(t)Bj(- ). Denote the elements in the first row by (0, 1, 2, и и и , nj-1). For m = 1, 2, и и и , nj - 1,

In the light of the above corrected Lemma, the operator T(x) [1, eqn.(44) and eqn.(45)] should be replaced by the following equations. Note that [1, eqn.(45)] remains same. Keeping all notations same as in [1] we define

Let N > 0, r~ > 0 be such that |Ep,(tpr~)| = 1mjaxl|Ep,(tpj)|,  > 0. Denote |A| by a and q  N\{1}. As a consequence of the above corrections, [1, Lemma 8 part 1 and part

Hence the proof.

Lemma 9 part 1 (cf. [1, eqn. (74)]) takes the following form while Lemma 9 part 2 and

part 3(cf. [1, eqn. (75) and eqn. (76)]) remain the same.

(35)

Note that from rectified Lemma 8 it is clear that integral in  exists in Rn, and hence 

is well defined.

The proof follows on similar lines as in the original article [1].

Lemma 10 from ref. [1] remains same. For the sake of completeness, we re-state the

results below: Lemma 10. Let x, y  C[I, Rn] and r := { x , y }, then

f (x(t)) - f (y(t))  r x(t) - y(t) , (t  0),

(36)

whenever x, y  Nr(0). Then for any ,   Rn, following inequalities hold:

7

1. T(x) - T(y)   M5(N, q, r~, a)r x - y  + K9(N, q, r~, a)  -  .

(37)

2. T(x)   M5(N, q, r~, a)r x  + K9(N, q, r~, a)  .

(38)

Proof of local stable manifold theorem, Step II: Owing to the changes in the operator u, [1, eqn. (119) - eqn. (125)] should be replaced by the following.
Consider the unstable projection of y(t) for t > N~ ,

uy(t)

 K3(N~ , q, r~) + K5(N~ , q, r~, a) uf (y( )) ,

(39)

where the last inequality is due to corrected Lemma 8. Note

uf (y( ))  f (y( ))  L+(L + ).

(40)

In view of eqn. (39)

uy(t)  L+(L + ) K3(N~ , q, r~) + K5(N~ , q, r~, a)

 L+(L + ) M5(N~ , q, r~, a)

 (L + ).

(41)

Hence the proof for the step II follows. The rest of the proof of the theorem remains same.

3 Illustrative Examples
We discuss the example discussed in ref. [1] below. Due to the corrections proposed in Section 2 of this paper, the local stable manifold will be different, and is presented in the following example.

Note that Es = x0  R2/2 = 0 . The stable and unstable projections are defined as

where K is an arbitrary constant. Since (t)  0 is given, eqn. (60) proves the claim.

Example 3. The fractional ordered Liu system is defined as

Dx1 = -ax1 - ex22

Dx2 = bx2 - kx1x3

(61)

Dx3 = -cx3 + mx1x2,

denotes the Jacobian matrix of the system (61) around an equilibrium point (0, 0, 0)T . 1(t)

Let x(0) = x0 = 2(t) be the given initial condition. In this case system (61) can be

3(t)

re-written in the form

Dx = Ax + f (x), x(0) = x0.

(62)

Solving the linear part of the system (61) we get stable and unstable subspaces as

Es = x0  R3 2 = 0 , Eu = x0  R3 1 = 3 = 0 .

(63)

Thus the stable and unstable projection maps are given as

ux = (0, x2, 0)T , sx = (x1, 0, x3)T .

(64)

Solving system (61) we get

x1(t) = Ep(-tp)1, and x3(t) = Ep(-5tp)3.

(65)

Using unstable projection of operator in (19) and fact that x is the fixed point we get

ux(t) = Ep(tpA)

For p = 0.5, the local stable manifold of the (61) around origin is plotted in figure (1).

4 Conclusions
Equation in Lemma 4 part 2 of the ref. [1] has been corrected. Further local stable manifold theorem has been established following the approach given in [1]. The example given in [2] has been discussed and it is shown that ux  0 in view of the corrections presented here.
